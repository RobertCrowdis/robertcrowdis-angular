# A little bit about my website

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3. **It currently is running on version 9.1.6**

## Setup

Run `npm i` in the root of the project to install dependencies. To start the application, run `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Testing the service worker locally

If you haven't already , run `npm i` to install defendencies. Run `npm run start-http` to start the application, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`. The application should work when changing your network settings to offline thanks to the service worker.

When testing Angular service workers, it's a good idea to use an incognito or private window in your browser to ensure the service worker doesn't end up reading from a previous leftover state, which can cause unexpected behavior.

## Why Angular?

I wanted to create a project with the intention of showing what I'm capable of as a web developer. Even though Angular may be overkill for a person website, it also showcases my skills and code practices. Some of the following include:

* Writing meaningful commit messages, working with Git branches and master in a proper manner.
* Managing state with RxJs and handling asynchronous code.
* Styling with a commercial UI library such as Angular Material.
* Designing websites with accessibility and the end user in mind.
* Animations *(In development...)*
* Working with a REST endpoint *(In development...)*
* Show off components that I create *(In development...)*

This is the first update of the Readme, and there is more to come for sure - so check back soon!
